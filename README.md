# Distribution Confidence Applet

This interactive web app visualizes confidence intervals for both the standard normal distribution and the Student's t-distribution. Users can adjust the confidence level, critical value, and (for the t-distribution) degrees of freedom, and see the corresponding shaded areas and probabilities.

## Features

- **Tabbed interface:** Switch between the Normal and Student's t-distributions.
- **Normal Distribution Tab:**
  - Adjust confidence level (%).
  - Adjust critical value (z) with a slider.
  - See shaded confidence region and tails.
  - Labels for confidence percentage, tail areas, and critical values.
- **Student's t-Distribution Tab:**
  - Adjust confidence level (%).
  - Adjust degrees of freedom (1â€“500).
  - Adjust critical value (t) with a slider.
  - See shaded confidence region and tails.
  - Labels for confidence percentage, area under the curve, tail areas, and critical values (labeled as `-t = ...` and `t = ...`).
